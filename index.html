                <p>The one city that I would like to visit is London.There is never a lack of attraction or interest in
                    London as a travel destination. The royal plot is the major reason why I want to visit London, I
                    have always wanted to visit Buckingham Palace to learn about the British monarchy. Popular
                    attractions such as the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral are the main
                    reasons why I want to visit London. What makes visiting London so interesting is the easy way to get
                    from one place to another without a car, I find that so amusing because where I come from this is
                    not possible. What I like is that London has so many attractions so while in London enjoying the
                    city you can still continue traveling in London and easily visit famous landmarks such as Tower
                    Bridge and The Shard's Skydeck in one day.</p>

            <p>Arabic is the foriegn language that I am interested in learning because Arabic was chosen by Allah, and
                the Islamic scriptures are written entirely in Arabic therefore I struggle a lot when reading the Arabic
                Quran because I do not understand anything hence why I see the need for me to learn the language. Infact
                it is important for all Muslims to learn to read and speak Arabic in order to be able to understand and
                interpret Allah's words by reading prayer and Quran</p>

                        The five bastions of the Castle Leerdam, Buuren, Katzenellenbogen, Nassau, and Oranje were named

                        <strong>Three interesting facts about Iziko Museum</strong>
                        The District Six Museum Foundation was not established until 1989, and the museum itself was
                        established in 1994.
                        The museum serves as a remembrance of the once lively multi-racial area that was forcefully
                        removed during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s.
                        Over 60,000 of its inhabitants were forcibly removed during the 1970s by the apartheid regime.
